Hibernate Training Examples Working

Replace the HiberUtil files on all examples to use the default H2 Db of hibernate. If you want to use derby db available to lig of jdk than need to uncomment the utill class lines, so that it used the cfg file related db. We need to change the dialect on cfg to derby. If you use default h2 no need to change , just let comments on util class be as it is.
